Start a container from the pulled image, mapping port 3000:

    docker run -p 3000:3000 --name dashboard_app_instance ghcr.io/kidra94/dashboard-container-ghcr:latest

    - p 3000:3000: Maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.

    - --name dashboard_app_instance: Assigns a name to your container instance (optional).

    - ghcr.io/kidra94/dashboard-container-ghcr:latest: The public image tag.
